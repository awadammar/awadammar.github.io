My journey in software engineering has been anything but linear, and that's exactly what makes it exciting. From designing real-time control systems for submarines with 100ms latency to optimizing enterprise software at one of the world's largest automotive companies, I've learned that every challenge teaches you something new about what's possible with code.

It all started during my Computer Engineering studies at Ain Shams University, where I graduated in the top 15% of my class. But the real learning began when I stepped into the professional world. At Innovation Hub, I created the Maquette Mapper tool that achieved a 4.7/5 satisfaction rating. At Robotech, I co-designed submarine control systems and implemented machine learning models that reduced navigation errors by 30%. Each role taught me something different about building software that performs under pressure.

The turning point came when I joined BMW Group as a Senior Software Engineer. Here, I discovered the power of strategic thinking combined with deep technical expertise. My work on infrastructure automation now impacts 60+ developers and handles 120+ weekly pull requests. I've re-architected logging services, built robust CI/CD pipelines using Python and Ansible, and even created developer tools that thousands of engineers rely on daily.

But what I'm most proud of isn't just the business value I've delivered, it's the 5 junior engineers and students I've mentored along the way. Watching someone go from struggling with basic concepts to confidently architecting their own solutions is incredibly rewarding. I've also contributed to open-source projects like Apache Log4j and published research on neural machine translation, because I believe knowledge should be shared.

Today, I'm passionate about exploring how AI can enhance software engineering. Whether it's building transformer models for code translation or optimizing JVM performance with cutting-edge techniques, I'm always looking for ways to push the boundaries of what's possible.
